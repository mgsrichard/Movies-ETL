# Movies-ETL (Extract Transform Load)
## ETL project for AmazingPrime Hackathon 

This week's work was cleaning up and merging data from wikipedia and ratings from MovieLens via Kaggle for more than 6,000 movies.  The deliverable files represent different stages of the data work. The four deliverables and their purposes are:

### Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files - ETL_function_test.ipynb
The first deliverable creates a function that reads in the three data files and stores each of them in their own DataFrames.  The three files are the wikipedia movie data, the Kaggle movie metadata, and the Kaggle ratings data.

### Deliverable 2: Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data - ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb

### Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle Data - ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb

### Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database - ETL_create_database.ipynb
